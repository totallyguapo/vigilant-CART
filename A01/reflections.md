I believe the process of gen AI is based on a machine having processed an appreciable portion of the extant information on earth in terms of inputs and outputs. Given their patterns, it can motivically extrapolate outputs given novel inputs
I believe also that there is a concept of ‘denoising’ for the computer to reach an output: the noise almost like a hunk of marble to a sculptor. In an image each pixel permutates until its relation to nearby pixels satisfies a certain likeness constraint, resulting in the collage aesthetic often returned by models like GPT-4: where random elements seems to pop into unexpected places within the composition. The technology not only benefits productivity, but can create variations on existing inputs, which is often how I understand art to be generated. For instance, Haydn often judged a pianist by their ability to make variations on a theme, which he would give to his pupils randomly. 
In this project, generative AI demonstrates that variations on a theme come out to show us very easily. 

The following work was prompted by me into DAHLE through GPT-4. I have been communicating endlessly with GPT-4 about ideas for my conch DMI, as well as fractals, and pomegranates.
I prompted the image by asking for a balloon lung. I found its likeness to pomegranates to be an inspiring connection that had not occurred to me on my own. I often find that GPT makes connections that excite me, though they had never occured to me after many hours spent pondering associations.

GPT claims to keep track of your user profile to respond more intelligently. Its a reasurring idea to have a permanent 'friend' to communicate your deepest artistic ideas to, that you can influence, and that they can then in turn influence you.  Is it an echo chamber? Sometimes--but its ability to prompt novel ideas is a miracle.
